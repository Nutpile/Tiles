==========
Tiles! is a simple game where your goal is to set all tiles to one colour in the
least amount of moves, but changing a tile also switches the adjacient ones.

coded by Valerio "Nutpile" Casalino, this is still a very heavy work in progress,  
and it will be for a bit of time! so hold on while i work.
